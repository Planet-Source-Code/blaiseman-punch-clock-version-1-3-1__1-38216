Each day of work can be saved and retrieved for later use.
Double click the Calendar date when loading a specific work day.  This will load your hours for that day.  <Note> You may have to press the Calculate button in case your Work Week Schedule changed (i.e. Compressed or Standard work week).
Changing between a Standard work week and a Compressed work week is simple. Just select "Data" from the menu bar and then select "Week Type".
Clicking the Reset button does not delete your data.  It only clears the input screen.
Selecting "Data" from the menu bar and then selecting "Insert Day" will put the current time into whatever field has focus (excluding Hours Worked and Hours OT).
Hours Worked is the total hours worked for the day and Hours OT is the difference between Hours Worked and your work week type.
